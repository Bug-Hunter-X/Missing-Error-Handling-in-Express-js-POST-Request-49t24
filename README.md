# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for invalid or missing request body data in POST requests.  The `missingErrorHandling.js` file shows the buggy code, while `missingErrorHandlingSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description
The original code lacks error handling for scenarios where the request body is missing or contains invalid data.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or vulnerabilities.

## Solution
The solution involves adding checks to validate the request body data before processing it.  This ensures that the application handles invalid input gracefully and prevents unexpected errors.
